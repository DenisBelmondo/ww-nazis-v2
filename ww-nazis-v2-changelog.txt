CHANGES SINCE INITIAL V2 PUBLIC BETA:
	Luger's firing animation got fixed.
	PPSh-41's recoil reduced.
	Fixed PPSh-41's initial ammo dump that wasn't spawning.
	Thompson and Lee-Enfield now start loaded.
	Added Panzerschreck, replacing BFG. Thanks to BouncyTEM for graphics.
	PPSh-41 now has new graphic by Nosehair26.
	Adjusted weapon ordering in KEYCONF so that MP40 is first on slot 4.
	Adjusted selection priority so that the pistols will not get autoselected when picked up.
	BouncyTEM submitted extra Wehrmacht soldiers and officers; they are now added among the regular spawns.
	Added Blox's improved flame death frames.
	Lee-Enfield and Gewehr 43 rebalanced. Gewehr's projectiles now fly slightly slower, while Lee-Enfield's fly faster and do more damage to compensate for bolt-action.
	Thompson's damage and muzzle velocity increased.
	Heretic support given a much-needed kick in the teeth - more available weapons, ammo now actually available for all of them, and shotgun spawns are fixed so that they now actually give you shotguns 100% of the time.
	Massive exploits regarding the two shotguns were plugged up - reloading no longer skips over the pumping animation, and it is now slower to fire the Browning Auto-5 with the Reload key held down than it is naturally. Shotgun reloads are now required to pump afterwards if interrupted with the fire button.
	Weapon selection now occurs twice as fast on all weapons except the Panzerschreck.
	Added Chex Quest support, courtesy of Snarboo...with a twist.
	Renamed some of the sprites and one sound file so that they do not replace things that they shouldn't.
	Backpack recolored.
	Enemies are now capable of hurting each other on Bund Deutscher Madel and Morgenspaziergang difficulties.

CHANGES SINCE "FINAL" VERSION:
    Most weapons that are placed in maps were changed - instead of being the same guns you can get off the nazis themselves, they are now the Thompson (replaces Chaingun), the PPSh-41 (replaces the Plasma Rifle), and the Lee-Enfield (replaces the Chainsaw). With the exception of the Enfield, they take unique ammo types and come with piles of ammo.
    The FG-42 is now dropped (half the time) by Paratroopers. The other half the time, he drops a 5-round Mauser clip.
    MP-40 sped up by half a tic.
    StG-44 slowed down by two tics, power beefed, and ammo drops reduced to suit.
    Officers now drop Lugers instead of P-38s. The Luger does slightly less damage but is more accurate, and can be fired as fast as you can click the trigger.
    Dr. Schabbs no longer glows in the dark.
    Weapon bobbing now altered, thanks to Xaser for implementing that in ZDoom.
    Reloading now requires a press of the ZDoom standard issue Weapon Reload key instead of Altfire.
    Flamethrower received a crap ton of updates, including better animations, MUCH improved flame projectiles, and it now needs to be reloaded!
    Majorly fixed up and updated the Lore text.
