Description             : Nazis, nazis, and more nazis. This mod replaces
                          ALL Doom 2 enemies with SS, Afrika Korps, and
                          other Wolfenstein-inspired (but not directly
                          recreated) enemies, as well as new World War
                          2-era weaponry. I recommend playing with Epic2.
						  v2 includes a shitton of new stuff.
